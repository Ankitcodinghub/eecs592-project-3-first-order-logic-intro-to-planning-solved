<li><strong>R&amp;N Problem 8.10:&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
Consider a vocabulary with the following symbols:

<em>Occupation(p, o): </em>Predicate. Person <em>p</em> has occupation <em>o</em>.

<em>Customer (p1,p2)</em>: Predicate. Person <em>p1</em> is a customer of person <em>p2</em>.

<em>Boss(p1,p2): </em>Predicate. Person <em>p1</em> is a boss of person <em>p2</em>.

<em>Doctor , Surgeon, Lawyer , Actor: </em>Constants denoting occupations.&nbsp; <em>Emily, Joe:</em> Constants denoting people.

Use these symbols to write the following assertions in first-order logic:

<ol>
<li>Emily is either a surgeon or a lawyer.</li>
<li>Joe is an actor, but he also holds another job.</li>
<li>All surgeons are doctors.</li>
<li>Joe does not have a lawyer (i.e., is not a customer of any lawyer).</li>
<li>Emily has a boss who is a lawyer.</li>
<li>There exists a lawyer all of whose customers are doctors.</li>
<li>Every surgeon has a lawyer.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>R&amp;N Problem 8.20:</strong></li>
</ol>
Arithmetic assertions can be written in first-order logic with the predicate symbol &lt;, the function symbols + and *, and the constant symbols 0 and 1.&nbsp; Additional predicates can also be defined with biconditionals.

<ol>
<li>Represent the property ‚Äúx is an even number.‚Äù</li>
<li>Represent the property ‚Äúx is prime.‚Äù</li>
<li>Golbach‚Äôs conjecture is the conjecture (unproven as yet) that every even number is equal to the sum of two primes. Represent this conjecture as a logical sentence.</li>
</ol>
<em>&nbsp;</em>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>R&amp;N Problem 9.6:&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
Write logical representations for the following sentences, suitable for use with Generalized Modus Ponens:

<ol>
<li>Horses, cows, and pigs are mammals.</li>
<li>An offspring of a horse is a horse.</li>
<li>Bluebeard is a horse.</li>
<li>Bluebeard is Charlie‚Äôs parent.</li>
<li>Offspring and parent are inverse relations.</li>
<li>Every mammal has a parent.</li>
</ol>

<li><strong>R&amp;N Problem 9.13: </strong>&nbsp; In this exercise, use the sentences you wrote in Exercise 9.6 (Problem 4 of this assignment) to answer a question by using a backward-chaining algorithm.
<ol>
<li>Draw the proof tree generated by an exhaustive backward-chaining algorithm for the query ‚àÉ<em> h Horse(h)</em>, where clauses are matched in the order given.</li>
<li>What do you notice about this domain?</li>
<li>How many solutions for <em>h</em> actually follow from your sentences?</li>
<li>Can you think of a way to find all of them? (Hint: See Smith et al. (1986) ‚Äì R&amp;N bibliography.)</li>

<li><strong>R&amp;N Problem 9.23:</strong>&nbsp; From ‚ÄúHorses are animals,‚Äù it follows that ‚ÄúThe head of a horse is the head of an animal.‚Äù&nbsp; Demonstrate that this inference is valid by carrying out the following steps:</li>
<li>Translate the premise and the conclusion into the language of first-order logic. Use three predicates: <em>HeadOf(h,x)</em> (meaning ‚Äú<em>h</em> is the head of <em>x</em>‚Äù), <em>Horse(x)</em>, and <em>Animal(x).</em></li>

<li>Light sleepers do not have anything that howls at night.</li>

<li><strong>R&amp;N 10.2 (Flying) </strong>(5 points)</li>
</ol>
Given the action schemas and initial state from R&amp;N Figure 10.1 (reproduced below), what are all the applicable concrete instances of <em>Fly(p, from, to)</em> in the state described by:

&nbsp;

<em>At(P1, JFK ) </em>‚àß<em> At(P2, SFO) </em>‚àß<em> Plane(P1) </em>‚àß<em> Plane(P2) </em>‚àß<em> Airport(JFK ) </em>‚àß<em> Airport(SFO) </em>

<ol start="10">
<li><strong>R&amp;N 10.4 (Shakey the Robot)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
The original STRIPS planner was designed to control Shakey the robot.&nbsp; Figure 10.14 (from R&amp;N, reproduced below) shows a version of Shakey‚Äôs world consisting of four rooms lined up along a corridor, where each room has a door and a light switch.&nbsp; The actions in Shakey‚Äôs world include moving from place to place, pushing movable objects (such as boxes), climbing onto and down from rigid objects (such as boxes), and turning light switches on and off.&nbsp; The robot itself could not climb on a box or toggle a switch, but the planner was capable of finding and printing out plans that were beyond the robot‚Äôs abilities.&nbsp; Shakey‚Äôs six actions are the following:

<ul>
<li><em>Go(x,y,r),</em> which requires that Shakey be <em>At</em> <em>x</em> and that <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are locations <em>In</em> the same room <em>r</em>. By convention a door between two rooms is in both of the rooms.</li>
<li><em>Push(b,x,y,r):</em> Push a box <em>b</em> from location <em>x</em> to location <em>y</em> within the same room You need the predicate <em>Box</em> and constants for the boxes.</li>
<li><em>ClimbUp(x,b):</em> Climb onto a box <em>b</em> from position <em>x</em>; requires predicate <em>On(x,y)</em> (<em>x</em> is on <em>y</em>) and constant <em>Floor</em>.</li>
<li><em>ClimbDown(b,x):</em> Climb down from a box <em>b</em> to position <em>x</em>.</li>
<li><em>TurnOn(s,b), TurnOff(s,b):</em> Turn a light switch <em>s</em> on (or off).&nbsp; To successfully achieve a light switch action, Shakey must be on top of a box <em>b</em> at the light switch‚Äôs location (room).</li>
</ul>
Write PDDL sentences for Shakey‚Äôs six actions and the initial state from Figure 10.14.&nbsp; Manually construct a plan for Shakey to get <em>Box2</em> into <em>Room2</em>.
